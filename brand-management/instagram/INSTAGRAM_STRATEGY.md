## Content Strategy

### Posting Cadence
- **Feed posts**: 3-4x/week (currently averaging 2.3x/week)
- **Stories**: 5-7x/week (currently strong at ~4x/week)
- **Reels**: 2x/week (currently only 0.4x/month — biggest growth opportunity)

### Content Mix for Bear Community
| Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Art posts (JMA series) | 2x/week | Core identity, saves-magnet |
| Reels (process, lifestyle) | 2x/week | Discovery & reach |
| Relationship/love content | 1x/week | Emotional connection |
| Bear community engagement | Daily stories | Community building |
| Fashion/brand collabs | 1-2x/month | Credibility & reach |

### Hashtag Strategy
**Primary (use 5-8 per post):**
`#bearlife` `#gaybear` `#bearcommunity` `#lgbtqart` `#queerart` `#bearweek` `#jupitermonamour`

**Secondary (rotate):**
`#gaybearcouple` `#bearlove` `#queercreatives` `#lgbtqcommunity` `#pocketbear` `#bearculture` `#gayartist`

**Location-based:**

## Growth Levers

### 1. Reels (Biggest Opportunity)
- Current: 5 reels total → only 0.4/month
- Target: 8x/month

- Ideas: art process timelapses, "bear gets ready" series, couple content, poetry spoken word

### 2. Saves Optimization
- Saves are your strongest metric (1,507 in period, +248%)
- Create "save-worthy" content: art tutorials, quotes, fashion inspo carousels
- Add "Save this for later" CTA in captions

### 3. Collaborations
- Tag Bear community pages in stories and posts
- Offer art/design swaps with Bear creators
- Join Bear events and post about them
- Partner with @neude.nyc for more shoots
